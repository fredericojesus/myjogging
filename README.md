# My jogging, an App using the MEAN stack + Gulp + Angular Material

### Getting up and running

1. Clone this repo
2. Install nodejs and mongo if you don't have them yet
3. Run mongod
4. Run `npm install` from the root directory (it will run bower install automatically also, you need to install bower globally `npm install bower -g`)
5. Run `gulp serve-dev` (may require installing Gulp globally `npm install gulp -g`)
6. Your browser will automatically be opened and redirected to the browser-sync proxy address
7. You can also see a task listing just by running `gulp` or `gulp help` in your prompt window
